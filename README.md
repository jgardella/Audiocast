Audiocast is a program for broadcasting audio from one or multiple sources to a range of users on a local network.

Running the Server
------------------
1. Plug in all of the audio sources; rename them in your Sound device settings to "Audiocast #" where # is a number.
2. Compile and run the `Server.java` class.
3. The server will display a list of possible sources; you can play these sources to preview their audio. Activate the source to begin broadcasting it to the clients.

Running the Client
------------------
1. Change the HOST_ADDRESS in `PlayerClient.java` to the address of the server.
2. Run the client. You can select from the sources that the server has activated and play them.
